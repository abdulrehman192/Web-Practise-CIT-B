    <p> Contrary to popular belief, <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is not simply random text. <i>It has roots in a piece of</i> classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years. <br> Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
        looked
        <b><i>up one of the more obscure Latin words</i></b>, consectetur,<br> from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
        1.10.33 of "de
        <b>Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</b>" (<u><i><b>The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics</b></i></u>, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
        dolor sit amet..",
        <u>comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</u></p>
